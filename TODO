[ ] Move this to Trello

[x] Write unit tests using Jasmine
	http://jasmine.github.io/

[ ] Investigate Travis for automated testing, as suggested here: http://howtonode.org/http-mock-testing
	https://travis-ci.org/

[x] Made decision to keep each topic stream separate (combining results at the very end) - so continuing with:
	[x] Filter by score
	[x] Redundancy check (persistent storage? https://github.com/simonlast/node-persist)

[ ] Hook up mobile notifications with Instapush
	https://instapush.im/

[ ] Documentation generator
	http://jashkenas.github.io/docco/

[ ] Figure out how I want to log in production
	Loggly (https://www.loggly.com/) + Winston (http://docs.nodejitsu.com/articles/intermediate/how-to-log) ?
	http://leanstack.io/log-management

[ ] What should happen when exceptions are thrown? Currently, exceptions seem to corrupt the state of persistent storage

[~] Look into automating tasks for building/testing/deploying, like Grunt (http://leanstack.io/javascript-build-tools)
